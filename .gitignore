#   According to https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/269 Pipfile.lock is not
#   supposed to be ignored, but if you feel otherwise, feel free to uncomment
#   the following line:
#Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is not recommended to ignore poetry.lock and pyproject.toml
#   files. They are essential for reproducibility.

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is not recommended to ignore pdm.lock and pyproject.toml
